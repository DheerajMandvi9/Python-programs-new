Atoms of different elements excepting noble gases do not have
complete octet so they combine with other atoms to form chemical bond.
The force which holds the atoms or ions together within the molecule is
called a chemical bond and the process of their combination is called
Chemical Bonding. It depends on the valency of atoms.
